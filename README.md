Hello, I'm Martin Donadieu! Welcome to Indie Maker! Here you will find podcasts where I interact with Makers who have turned their ideas into a flourishing business.

Beyond their success story, we will decipher their history, their strategy, their challenges, in order to understand how they managed to become profitable.

I ask different types of Makers, novices, seasoned, always in order to understand how they started and how they made their business sustainable.

Whoever you are, in this podcast you will learn to become an Indie Maker, all without taking yourself seriously!
